I am a Lecturer of Information Systems at Universitas Ma Chung and the Editor-in-Chief of the Kurawal Journal, a reputable journal in information systems and information technology. Previously, I worked as a Research Associate at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, New York. My research interests are algorithms and programming, and knowledge management systems.

Research
======
My research interests lie broadly in algorithms, programming, and knowledge management systems. I am particularly passionate about exploring efficient, scalable, and adaptable solutions that address real-world challenges in both theoretical and applied contexts.

Currently, my focus revolves around the development of algorithmic techniques for problem-solving, optimization, and their practical applications in programming education. I am also deeply engaged in advancing knowledge management systems to enhance the structuring, sharing, and utilization of organizational knowledge for decision-making and innovation.

A list of topics I am actively thinking about and working on includes:
* Algorithm Design and Optimization: Exploring efficient algorithmic strategies for complex computational problems, with a focus on improving performance and scalability in data processing and software development.

* Programming Education: Investigating effective pedagogical methods and tools to teach fundamental programming concepts, such as nested loops and data structures, emphasizing clarity and practical application for beginners.

* Knowledge Management Systems (KMS): Developing frameworks and methodologies to improve knowledge capture, sharing, and reuse within organizations, including the use of knowledge mapping and knowledge bases for service quality improvement.

* Integration of KMS with Emerging Technologies: Exploring how KMS can be enhanced with modern technologies such as artificial intelligence for better knowledge retrieval, decision support, and automation.

I am particularly interested in bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and their practical applications, ensuring both educational impact and industry relevance.
