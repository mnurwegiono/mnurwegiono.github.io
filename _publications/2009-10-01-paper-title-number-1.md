Burger restaurants face challenges in improving ordering and payment efficiency, especially in the digital era that demands fast and accurate service. This study aims to develop a mobile application that facilitates digital ordering and payment using the Waterfall approach. This research method involves four stages: Analysis, to identify system requirements based on interviews with restaurant managers; System design, to create a user interface model and application architecture; Coding, to implement the application using Android Studio; and Testing, which is done using the black-box testing method. Trials or testing were conducted at a local burger restaurant to ensure that each application function runs according to specifications. The test results showed a success rate of application functionality reaching 95%, with online ordering and digital payment features running accurately. In addition, the application was able to reduce ordering time by up to 50% compared to manual methods. In conclusion, the Waterfall-based mobile application is effective in improving the operational efficiency of burger restaurants. Further development is recommended by adding order tracking and analytics features to support managerial decisions.
